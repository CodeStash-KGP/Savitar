Savitar: A lightning fast way to login into KGP ERP

It's time to move into the world of automation and, what's better place than our beloved old ERP. This chrome extension lets you log into ERP
automatically once you save your credentials in the application.

Based on [KGP ERP Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/erp-extension-for-kgpians/cpehhocmbickbkapejcdojbpbhpchocb), which doesn't work
anymore due to change in ERP's domain.

DISCLAIMER: We do not store any credentials, and the source code is provided to verify the same.

## Installing Into Chrome

[here](https://github.com/thealphadollar/savitar).
2. If you downloaded as zip, extract the files and folders.
3. Open your google chrome and goto `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable "developer mode" at the top right.
5. Click `LOAD UNPACKED` and select the `kgp_erp_extension` directory inside the cloned or unzipped folder.
6. Voila! You've the extension installed. Click on the icon, set the options and witness "god of speed".
