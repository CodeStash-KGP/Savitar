Savitar: A lightning fast way to login into KGP ERP

It's time to move into the world of automation and, what's better place than our beloved old ERP. This chrome extension lets you log into ERP
automatically once you save your credentials in the application.

The application logs you into the KGP ERP when you visit the erp website and also skips the annoying form that comes up afterwards.

DISCLAIMER: We do not store your credentials, and the source code is provided to verify the same.

anymore due to change in ERP's domain.
